      <p>To introduce myself-I would characterize myself as an ambitious and adventurous person. It is probably this personality trait in me that sparked my passion in flying, and I worked hard to land myself an amazing opportunity to train as a commercial pilot. But when covid struck, life had other plans for me, and I found myself working as a 'Business Analyst' in a freight-forwarding firm in Hyderabad.</p> 
      <p>I am a currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at University of Washington - Foster School of Business. I have a background in Computer Science with a particular and strong interest in the intersection of technology and business. My professional aspiration is to work in a data-driven field, possibly as a data/business intelligence analyst, while also exploring opportunities in cybersecurity and tech consultancy.</p> 
      <p>A few interesting things about me. I am an avid gamer and athlete. I enjoy playing competitive strategy games and love playing racquet sports. </p>
